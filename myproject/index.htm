                    on our planet, its time to start a new life.

             Circumstantial evidence has pointed to the plausibility of life on Mars, not only in the ancient past, but possibly still living, and perhaps occasionally active, even today.
            These assumptions are long gone. Now, you will be provided everything that you had on Earth; Oxygen, Food, Water, and other life necessities. Obviously, artificially made. As, it is the price that we pay to ruin a beautiful thing! </p>

            , not a wise decision.
